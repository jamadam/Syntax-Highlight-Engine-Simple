=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a Syntax highlight Engine. This generates a part of HTML string by
marking up the input string with span tags along the given rules so that you
can easily coloring with CSS.

Advantage is the simpleness. This provides a simple way to define the
highlighting rules by packing the complicated part of it into regular
expression. Also, This works faster than similar highlight solutions on rough
benchmarks.

Here is a working example of This module.

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 new

I<new> constractor calls for following arguments.

=over

B<type>

File type. This argument causes specific sub class to be loaded.

B<syntax>

With this argument, you can assign rules in constractor.

=back

=head2 setParams

This method calls for following arguments.

=over

B<html_escape_code_ref>

HTML escape code ref. Default subroutine escapes 3 characters '&', '<' and '>'.

=back

=head2 setSyntax

Set the rules for highlight. It calls for a argument I<syntax> in array.

    $highlighter->setSyntax(
        syntax => [
                {
                    class => 'tag',
                    regexp => "<.+?>",
                },
                {
                    class => 'quote',
                    regexp => "'.*?'",
                    container => 'tag',
                },
                {
                    class => 'wquote',
                    regexp => '".*?"',
                    container => 'tag',
                },
                {
                    class => 'keyword',
                    regexp => 'somekeyword',
                    container => ['tag', 'quote', 'wquote'],
                },
        ]
    );

The array can contain rules in hash which is consists of 3 keys, I<class>,
I<regexp> and I<container>.

=over

B<class>

This appears to the output SPAN tag. 

B<regexp>

Regular expression to be highlighted.

B<container>

Class names of allowed container. It can be given in String or Array. This
restricts the I<regexp> to stand only inside of the classes. This parameter
also works to ease the regulation some time. The highlighting rules doesn't
stand in any container in default. This parameter eliminates it.

=back

=head2 appendSyntax

Append syntax by giving a hash.

    $highlighter->setSyntax(
        syntax => {
            class       => 'quote',
            regexp      => "'.*?'",
            container   => 'tag',
        }
    );

=head2 doStr

Highlighting input string and returns the marked up string. This method calls
for following arguments.

=over

B<str>

String.

B<tab_width>

Tab width for tab-space conversion. -1 for disable it. -1 is the default.

=back

    $highlighter->doStr(
        str         => $str,
        tab_width   => 4
    );

=head2 doFile

Highlighting the file and returns the marked up string. This method calls for
following arguments.

=over

B<file>

File name.

B<tab_width>

Tab width for tab-space conversion. -1 for disable it. -1 is the default.

B<encode>

Set the encode of file. utf8 is the default.

=back

    $highlighter->doStr(
        str         => $str,
        tab_width   => 4,
        encode      => 'utf8'
    );

=head2 array2regexp

This is a utility method for converting string array to regular expression.

=over

=back

=head2 getClassNames

Returns the class names in array.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

I<Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Simple> requires no configuration files or
environment variables. Specific language syntax can be defined with
sub classes and loaded in constructor if you give it the type argument.
